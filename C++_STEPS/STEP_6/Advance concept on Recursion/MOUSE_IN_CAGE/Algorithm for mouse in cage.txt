Mouse in Cage (Using Recursion)

1)We need one function to know is it safe to move given x,y ?
>>This function will verify given X and Y is within Cage size and with block value '1'.

2)recursive function for finding path
>> Take given X and Y, check is it possible to move using first function, if yes update solution with value 1.
>> Move Right side, x++, if possible to move return true
>> Move Down side, y++ and back to original point x--, if possible to move return true
>> Other wise return false with soultion value 0.
