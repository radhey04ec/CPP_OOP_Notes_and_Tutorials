1) Pre processor:
Handle directives like #include, #define .#ifdef  etc
Output: Pure C or C++ file, with all MACRO expands and including libs

2)Compilation
Error checking (Syntax), 
Optimization,remove dead code, loops which are unroalling 
Warning for suspicious code,
Finally Convert into assembly code (Instruction - Human Readable form like 8085 MOVE,COPY,LDA etc.. but near to machine code)
Output: Assembly File (.s, .asm)

3)Assembler:
Convert assembly code into Machine code, binary format 1,0 which machine will execute.
Output Object file, (.o, .obj)

4)Linker: Combined all libs object file, other object files, into one executable
Also resolve function call,var reference. Assign Address, entry address of the function (by linker script through .map file)
Output: Executable bin (.bin, .elf,.hex) 

FAQ: Why size of .bin, .elf or .hex file are different?
1) .elf file contains CODE + DATA DEBUG SYMBOL + ADDRESS - Big size (use for full debugging with execution)
2) .bin file - contains only binary executable code, only actual bytes to be flashed (Typical use : Flashing controller)
3) .hex - Address + Data + Checksum  - Typically use loading through bootloader or programmer (ASCII HEX Format)

So, size difference because of METADATA, The controller memory usage is same regardless of file format.
